	//isbn = {0-544-00269-5},
	shorttitle = {Big Data},
	abstract = {A revelatory exploration of the hottest trend in technology and the dramatic impact it will have on the economy, science, and society at large.  Which paint color is most likely to tell you that a used car is in good shape? How can officials identify the most dangerous New York City manholes before they explode? And how did Google searches predict the spread of the H1N1 flu outbreak?  The key to answering these questions, and many more, is big data. “Big data” refers to our burgeoning ability to crunch vast collections of information, analyze it instantly, and draw sometimes profoundly surprising conclusions from it. This emerging science can translate myriad phenomena—from the price of airline tickets to the text of millions of books—into searchable form, and uses our increasing computing power to unearth epiphanies that we never could have seen before. A revolution on par with the Internet or perhaps even the printing press, big data will change the way we think about business, health, politics, education, and innovation in the years to come. It also poses fresh threats, from the inevitable end of privacy as we know it to the prospect of being penalized for things we haven’t even done yet, based on big data’s ability to predict our future behavior.  In this brilliantly clear, often surprising work, two leading experts explain what big data is, how it will change our lives, and what we can do to protect ourselves from its hazards. Big Data is the first big book about the next big thing. www.big-data-book.com},

	abstract = {Privacy advocates often like to claim that all modern societies feel the same intuitive need to protect privacy. Yet it is clear that intuitive sensibilities about privacy differ from society to society, even as between the closely kindred societies of the United States and continental Europe. Some of the differences involve questions of everyday behavior, such as whether or not one may appear nude in public. But many involve tha law. In fact, we are in the midst of major legal conflicts between the countries on either side of the Atlantic-conflicts over questions like the protection of consumer data, the use of discovery iin civil procedure, the public exposure of criminal offenders, and more. Clearly the idea that there are as the basis of a universal law of privacy, cannot be right. This Article explores these conflicts, trying to show that European privacy norms are founded on French and German ideas of "personal honor." Continental "privacy," like continental sexual harassment law, prison law, and many other bodies of law, aims to protect the "personal honor" of ordinary French and German folk. American law takes a very different approach, protecting primarily a liberty interest. The Article traces the roots of French and German attitudes over the last couple of centuries, highlighting the French experience of sexual license in the nineteenth century and the German experience of Nazism. The Articlee then discusses the current state of French and German law with regard to matters such as consumer credit reporting, public nudity, and the law of baby names. It contrasts continental approaches to what we find in American law. Throughout, the Article argues, American law shows a far greater sensitivity to intrusions on the part of the state, while continentla law shows a far greater sensitivity to the protection of one's public face. These are not differences that we can understand unless we abandon the approach taken by most privacy advocates, since such differences have little to do with the supposedly universal intuitive needs of "personhood." Instead, they are differences that reflect the constrasting political and social ideals of American and continental law. Indeed, we should broadly reject intuitionism in our legal scholarship, focusing instead on social and political ideals.},

	abstract = {In vehicular ad-hoc networks ({VANETs}), a use case for mobile ad-hoc networks ({MANETs}), the ultimate goal is to let vehicles communicate using wireless message exchange to provide safety, traffic efficiency, and entertainment applications. Especially traffic efficiency applications benefit from wide-area message dissemination, and aggregation of information is an important tool to reduce bandwidth requirements and enable dissemination in large areas. The core idea is to exchange high quality summaries of the current status rather than forwarding all individual messages. Securing aggregation schemes is important, because they may be used for decisions about traffic management, as well as traffic statistics used in political decisions concerning road safety and availability. The most important challenge for security is that aggregation removes redundancy and the option to directly verify signatures on atomic messages. Existing proposals are limited, because they require roads to be segmented into small fixed-size regions, beyond which aggregation cannot be performed. In this paper, we introduce {SeDyA}, a scheme that allows more dynamic aggregation compared to existing work, while also providing stronger security guarantees. We evaluate {SeDyA} against existing proposals to show the benefits in terms of information accuracy, bandwidth usage, and resilience against attacks.},
